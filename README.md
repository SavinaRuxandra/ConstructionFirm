# ConstructionFirm
Statement of the problem:
Bob is a young entrepreneur and wants to start a construction firm. He needs an application to store
the products for a better management. The application should to do these operations:
- Add a product
- Delete a product
- See the number of products he has in the storage
- See the quantity of a product
- Filter the products by their type. The type of the product is given by the first digit in its code
( 1 = DIY, 2 = thermic, 3 = electric, 4 = sanitary, from 5 to 9 = otherProducts)
The products will be stored using their codes.
Justification:
The ADT bag is a good choice for this application, because the order of the products does not matter.
It is also easier to keep track of the frequency of every product, and also the total number of products.
The bag is usually used for storing.
